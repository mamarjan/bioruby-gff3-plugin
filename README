= GFF3 plugin for BioRuby, aimed at parsing big data =

You can use this in two ways. First as a standalone program, next as a plugin
to BioRuby.

For example, fetch mRNA and CDS information from GFF3 files and output to FASTA:

  ./bin/gff3-fetch mrna test/data/gff/test.gff3
  ./bin/gff3-fetch cds test/data/gff/test.gff3

Or clone this repository and add the 'lib' dir to the Ruby search path and 

  require 'bio/db/gff/gffdb'

You can also run RSpec with something like

   ruby -I ../bioruby/lib/ ~/.gems/bin/spec spec/gffdb_spec.rb

This implementation depends on BioRuby's GFF3 parser, with the possible
advantage that it does not consume all memory.
