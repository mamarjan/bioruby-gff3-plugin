= GFF3 plugin for BioRuby, aimed at parsing big data =

Features:

# Take GFF (genome browser) information and digest mRNA and CDS sequences
# Options for low memory use and caching of records
# Support for external FASTA files

You can use this plugin in two ways. First as a standalone program, next as a
plugin library to BioRuby.

For example, fetch mRNA and CDS information from GFF3 files and output to FASTA:

  ./bin/gff3-fetch mrna test/data/gff/test.gff3
  ./bin/gff3-fetch cds test/data/gff/test.gff3

Or clone this repository and add the 'lib' dir to the Ruby search path and 

  require 'bio/db/gff/gffdb'

You can also run RSpec with something like

   ruby -I ../bioruby/lib/ ~/.gems/bin/spec spec/gffdb_spec.rb

This implementation depends on BioRuby's basic GFF3 parser, with the possible
advantage that it is faster and does not consume all memory.

Usage:

BioRuby GFF3 Plugin Copyright (C) 2010 Pjotr Prins <pjotr.prins@thebird.nl>

  Fetch and assemble mRNAs, or CDS and print in FASTA format. 

    gff3-fetch [--no-cache] mRNA|CDS [filename.fa] filename.gff

  Where:

    --no-cache      : do not load everything in memory 
    mRNA            : assemble mRNA
    CDS             : assemble CDS 

  Multiple GFF3 files can be used. For external FASTA files, always the last
  one before the GFF file is used.

  Examples:

    Find mRNA and CDS information from test.gff3 (which includes sequence information)

      ./bin/gff3-fetch mRNA test/data/gff/test.gff3
      ./bin/gff3-fetch CDS test/data/gff/test.gff3

    Find mRNA from external FASTA file, without loading everythin in RAM

      ./bin/gff3-fetch --no-cache mRNA test/data/gff/test-ext-fasta.fa test/data/gff/test-ext-fasta.gff3
